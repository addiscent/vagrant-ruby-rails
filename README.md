# vagrant-ruby-rails

### A Ruby On Rails Development Environment (Basic)

##### Containing Ubuntu Server 14.04, Ruby 2.2.1, Gems 2.4.6, Rails 4.2.1, RVM 1.26.11, Git 1.9.1, and Node.js 0.10.25.

This is a _Vagrant Box_, (https://www.vagrantup.com), intended for quick installation of a very basic _Ruby On Rails_ development environment.  Assuming _Vagrant_ and _VirtualBox_ are already installed on your host computer, (instructions not provided here), this _Vagrant Box_ may be quickly installed, intentionally "destroyed", (if desired), and quickly reinstalled.  Because it can rebuilt quickly if necessary, this _Vagrant Box_ may be handy for transient/experimental work, (perhaps due to a need for a sacrifial development environment), or simply as a way to quickly recover from unanticipated corruption of a long-term development environment.  It also allows easy reproduction and distribution of exact duplicates of a development environment shared among multiple project members.

_Git_ is included as a convenience, for quickly placing _Ruby/Rails_ or other sources into repositories.  You may also wish to customize this guest vbox's configuration and provisioning files, allowing you to easily recreate your custom guest vbox environment in the future.  In that case, _Git_ is useful for managing versions for yourself, or for sharing your customized guest vbox with others, using an online _git_ repository.

_Node.js_ is installed during installation of this guest vbox.  It is used during the compilation of one or more gems required by _Rails_.

The gem _Nokogiri_ is compiled and installed into the _RVM_ global gemset during installation of this guest vbox.
  
The virtual machine "provider" in this guest vbox is _VirtualBox_.

### Requirements For Installation

Your computer must have at least 1.3GB of available memory, (free RAM).

###### Caveat :  The computer used for development of this project is a generic _AMD/Linux_ box running _Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS_. If you install this guest vbox on _OS X_ or _Windows_, you are venturing into unexplored territory; installation may be successful, or it may fail.  Which of the two is unknown at this time.

Before beginning installation, you must already have the following installed and properly configured :
  
##### __Vagrant__

"vagrant-ruby-rails" is developed using _Vagrant_ 1.7.2, (the most recent from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).  You may have success with earlier versions of _Vagrant_, but I have built/tested using only 1.7.2.

##### _VirtualBox_

"vagrant-ruby-rails" is tested using _VirtualBox_ 4.3.10 as the provider, (a very slightly down-level version of the latest from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  You will probably have success with slightly earlier versions of _VirtualBox_, and the most recent stable version, but I have not tested those.

### Installation

#### Prepare For The Build

In the following sections, a terminal command prompt is indicated by the symbol $.

1. Create a "home" directory for the guest vbox in a convenient subdirectory location.  Name it whatever you wish, but, herein I will refer to it as "vagrant-ruby" :
    
    - $ mkdir vagrant-ruby

2. Download a zip file containing the files from the github repository page, https://github.com/ckthomaston/vagrant-ruby-rails.

  While using the same file and subdirectory hierarchy as in the repository, extract those files into the "vagrant-ruby" subdirectory you just created above.

3. Make the guest vbox "home" directory your current working directory :

    - $ cd vagrant-ruby

4. Enter the following command :
  
    - $ mkdir workspace
      
    A "vagrant-ruby/workspace/" subdirectory is created.
      
#### Do The Build

Enter the following command :
  
    - $ vagrant up
      
  The build starts.

Now wait...

A very long list of text messages is output during the build process, beginning with :
  
        "==> Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider..."
     
Depending on the speed of your computer and the speed of your Internet connection, the build will take eight to fifteen minutes or more, as the _Ubuntu Server_ "base" image is downloaded, _Ruby_ and the Gem sources are downloaded and compiled, and _RVM_ and _Git_ are downloaded and installed.

During that process, the build tools will output status/progress messages.  Most of the informational messages displayed are green in color, but, there will also be a _lot_ of red-color text output.  Seeing all that "blood" is somewhat alarming, but it is normal.  The output messages of gpg and curl are _red_ and the formatting is very _broken_.  This unpleasant output is an artifact of the "vagrant up" command, as _gpg_ and _curl_ typically have nice output.

Unfortunately, this messy output makes it difficult to spot a genuine error which should be investigated.  Typically, if the build fails, it often will stop with an obvious error message, but possibly not.  After the build finishes, you should scroll back through the terminal output messages and scrutinize them, because sometimes the build forges onward after an error.

However, until the build stops, don't be unnecessarily alarmed.  There are a number of _red_ messages which are not errors, they are informational only.  As an example, the _red_ text message,

        "==> default: stdin: is not a tty"
    
can be safely ignored.
  
After the build completes successfully, the last build line of screen output reads :
  
        "==> default: Setting up git (1:1.9.1-1ubuntu0.1) ..."
  
#### Verify The Build
##### Verify The Toolset Has Properly Installed

When the command prompt is subsequently displayed, enter the following command :
  
    - $ vagrant ssh
    
After a few seconds, you see an _Ubuntu_ shell welcome screen, and a command prompt which reads :
    
  vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
        
Enter the following commands.  Notice the components which have been installed, and their associated version numbers :
    
    - $ ruby --version         # verifies ruby installed
        
        Result :
        
          ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-linux]
            
    - $ gem --version          # version of gems
      
        Result : 2.4.6
        
    - $ rvm --version          # verifies rvm installed
        
        Result shown : rvm 1.26.11 (latest) by Wayne E. Seguin...
        
    - $ rvm gemset list        # lists ruby versions and gem sets managed by rvm
      
        Result :
        
          gemsets for ruby-2.2.1 (found in /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1)
          
              (default)
              
              global
              
              => rails4.2.1
        
    - $ rails --version        # verifies rails installed
      
        Result : 4.2.1
        
    - $ git --version          # verifies git installed
        
        Result : git version 1.9.1
        
##### Construct And Test A Minimal App Which Confirms Working _Rails_ Scaffolding

Enter the following commands.  These commands build and execute a "basic" _Rails_ app named "myapp" :
    
    - $ cd /workspace; mkdir myapp; cd myapp
  
        Result : A command prompt in the terminal.  "myapp" is the current workingdirectory

    - $ rvm use ruby-2.2.1@rails4.2.1
  
        Result : Using /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1 with gemset rails4.2.1

    - $ rails new .   # note the dot
  
        Result :
                  exist
                  
                  create  README.rdoc
                  
                  create  Rakefile
                  
                  create  config.ru
                  
                  create  .gitignore
                  
                      .
                      
                      .
                      
                      .
                      
                  Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
                  
                           run  bundle exec spring binstub --all
                           
                  * bin/rake: spring inserted
                  
                  * bin/rails: spring inserted

    - $ ls -l
  
        Result :

    - $ rails s -b 0.0.0.0   # 0.0.0.0 specification required for vagrant box
  
        Result :

The built in WEBrick test server is now running.  Using a web browser on your host, examine the resulting test web page at :

  http://localhost:3030
  
The test web page shows "Welcome aboard. Youâ€™re riding Ruby on Rails!".

You may now terminate execution of the _Rails_ WEBrick test server, by entering Ctrl-C in the guest vbox terminal.

You are finished with preliminary verification of a successful build.  You may now remove the "myapp" scaffolding test program, if you have no other use for it, by removing its subdirectory.  As always, double-check your spelling when entering a command which contains "rm -rf ...".

    - $ cd ../; rm -rf /workspace/myapp     # skip this if you wish
  
        Result :
        
          "myapp" deleted.  The current working directory is now /workspace.

### Using "vagrant-ruby-rails"

Not much can be said here about how to use _Ruby_, the _Gems_, _Rails_, _RVM_, _Git_, and the other usual suspects, such as the tools which come with _Ubuntu_.  Those subjects are better covered elsewhere.  But a few points unique to this particular project warrant some elaboration.
  
Note that, using the instructions above, you ventured "inside" the guest vbox using "vagrant ssh", to verify the success of the build and the versions of its components.  If you are not still there in your terminal, let's go back in there again, and do some exploring.

Starting from within the "vagrant-ruby" directory, in your regular host terminal shell, enter the command :
    
    - $ vagrant ssh
    
This will open a terminal shell into the guest vbox.  Then, enter :

    - $ ls -l /
    
In the resulting listing, notice the typical _Ubuntu Server 14.04_ root directory hierarchy, inside the guest vbox file system.

        vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ ls -l /
        
        total 92
        
        drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root     4096 Apr  6 20:06 bin
        
        drwxr-xr-x  3 root    root     4096 Apr  6 20:06 boot
        
        drwxr-xr-x 13 root    root     3880 Apr  8 20:43 dev
        
                .
                
                .
                
                .
                
        drwxrws---  1 vagrant vagrant  4096 Apr  8 08:34 vagrant
        
        drwxr-xr-x 13 root    root     4096 Apr  8 11:10 var
        
        lrwxrwxrwx  1 root    root       30 Apr  6 20:05 vmlinuz...
        
        drwxrws---  1 vagrant vagrant  4096 Apr  8 11:03 workspace
        
However, also notice there are two subdirectories not typically found in an _Ubuntu_ root directory hierarchy.  One is named "/vagrant", the other is "/workspace".  They are discussed below.

#### "/vagrant" and "/workspace"

The guest vbox "/vagrant" subdirectory is sync'd by _Vagrant_ to a directory you created earlier on the host, the one named (herein) "vagrant-ruby".  The guest vbox "/vagrant" subdirectory and the host "vagrant-ruby" directory, for practical purposes, can be considered as being the same directory; they are effectively "mapped into one".  Prove it to yourself by entering :

    - $ ls -l /vagrant
    
Note that the guest vbox's Vagrantfile and .sh provisioning BASH files, among others, are listed.

        drwxrws--- 2 user group 4.0K Apr  7 22:21 workspace
        
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 user group 1.1K Apr  7 22:58 LICENSE
        
        -rw-rw-r-- 1 user group  12K Apr  8 15:55 README.md
        
        -rw-rw---- 1 user group  110 Apr  7 21:17 ruby221-inst.sh
        
        -rw-rw---- 1 user group  375 Apr  7 22:01 rvm-inst.sh
        
        -rw-rw---- 1 user group 3.2K Apr  7 22:18 Vagrantfile

You may therefore manage or edit those files from either "within" the guest vbox, (in the "/vagrant" subdirectory), or from "outside" the guest vbox, (in the "vagrant-ruby" subdirectory). You may also use that directory, or any of its subdirectories, to share files between the host file system, and the guest vbox file system.
  
If desired, you can customize the configuration/operation of your guest vbox by modifying the Vagrantfile and .sh provisioning files.  Remember, some changes require completely rebuilding the guest vbox.  To rebuild the vagrant guest vbox image, you will need to do "vagrant destroy" and "vagrant up", after you customize these files, (see the _Vagrant_ documentation).  Beware.  If you do a complete rebuild, any changes made inside the guest vbox which have not been incorporated into the Vagrantfile and provisioning files will be lost, so before doing a "vagrant destroy", back up your work if necessary.

After doing that, if you wish to place those modified _Vagrant Box_ configuration files into a _git_ source repository of your own, the guest vbox's "/vagrant" directory is probably the best place to install a local _git_ repository, ("git init"), for that purpose.  _Git_ is ready to be executed from the "vagrant ssh" shell immediately after guest vbox installation.  All you need to do is enter your "git config..." info, such as your name and email address, (and remote repository URL, if desired), and _git_ is ready for use.
  
The other subdirectory atypical to the guest vbox _Ubuntu_ file system root is "/workspace".  This subdirectory is also sync'd to the host.  It is"mapped into" the other host subdirectory named "/workspace", which you created immediately before building the guest vbox.  This subdirectory is probably a good location for placing your _Ruby/Rails_ et al project files, as they may be edited or managed either from "within", or "outside of", the guest vbox.  As with the "/vagrant" directory, a _git_ repository may be placed in one or more subdirectories of "/workspace" as needed.

If this "/workspace" subdirectory is used for your _Ruby/Rails_ or other project files, they won't be co-mingled with your guest vbox configuration files in "/vagrant".  By segregating the two, version control management of guest vbox configuration changes and _Ruby_ project changes is simplified.

Another advantage gained from placing your project files in the "/vagrant" and "/workspace" directories, ("outside of the box"), is they are not deleted by a "vagrant destroy" command.  This can be a very useful side effect.  If you have placed any of your non-disposable project files "inside the box" during development, executing "vagrant destroy" without first backing up your project files will probably ruin your day.  By the way, did I mention _git_ is already installed and ready to go immediately after the guest vbox finishes building?

#### Other Notes
##### Port Mapping

Port mapping is an essential feature for resolving the problem of port number conflicts in a crowded system of server daemons, _Vagrant_ guest vboxes, Docker containers, etc.  The _Rails_ WEBrick server port default number is 3000.  The "vagrant-ruby-rails" Vagrantfile maps the guest vbox port number 3000 to the host's port number 3030.  The choice of port number 3030 is arbitrary.  If you wish to change this port mapping to a host number port which better suits your needs, you may do so by editing the Vagrantfile.  For more information, see the _Vagrant_ documentation about the "config.vm.network" directive.

##### Memory (RAM) Usage

This guest vbox needs 1GB of memory during installation because it compiles componenet sources at that time.  However, after installation of this guest vbox, you may need less memory, (or more), while developing your projects.  If that is the case, you may use the Vagrantfile memory directive to change the amount of memory consumed by this guest vbox when it is loaded into memory.  For more information, see the _Vagrant_ documentation about the "vb.memory" directive.
  
### Product Pedigree

The software components installed by the provisioning scripts are noted below.  Their versions may be updated in the future, but their initial commit versions are :

##### _Ubuntu Server_ 14.04 "base"
  
The _Ubuntu Server_ is an "official base" image from https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search.
        
##### _Ruby_ 2.2.1, _Gems_ 2.4.6, _Rails_ 4.2.1

##### _RVM_ 1.26.11, (Ruby Version Manager).
  
_RVM_ is installed using https://rvm.io/.
        
##### _Git_ 1.9.1
  
_Git_ is installed using the official _Canonical Ubuntu_ package repositories, "sudo apt-get install -y git".

##### _Node.js_ 0.10.25
  
_Node.js_ is installed using the official _Canonical Ubuntu_ package repositories, "sudo apt-get install -y nodejs".

##### Nokogiri 1.6.6.2
  
Nokigiri is installed by _gem_, "gem install nokogiri --no-document".

### Caveats

##### "works on my machine"

This product, at this time, is in the _alpha_ stage of development.  Extensive testing has not been done on its components, only its gross operation has been confirmed .  Hardware and host OS environment testing has been limited to the single generic AMD/Ubuntu Linux box used for development.

##### The Provisioning Scripts Are Incomplete

The provisioning BASH scripts build a working _Vagrant Box_ by downloading essential components/sources from the Internet.  The provisioning BASH scripts work, but, at this time they have _no_ error detection/handling.  If, as examples, a flaky Internet connection, or a lack of disk space, causes errors during the build, the provisioning scripts will _not_ handle these errors gracefully.
